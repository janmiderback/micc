# Mobile Internet Chess Client

This is a private project I did back in 2006/2007. It is a mobile chess client for playing realtime online chess at the Free Internet Chess Server - [FICS](https://www.freechess.org).

It is targeting MIDP-2.0/CLDC-1.1 so it is not exactly the latest and greatest...

There are many features of FICS that are not supported and I'm keeping the sources here just to go back and remember.
